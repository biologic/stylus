Stylus 1.2.0, Biologic Institute

http://biologicstylus.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/biologicstylus

BUILDING STYLUS
Stylus requires a few external libraries, the GNU C/C++ V4.x, and related tools such as libtool.
While Stylus may be built using the normal autoconf/automake/make sequence, it is easier to use the
supplied scripts: bootstrap and build.

The bootstrap script prepares the environment by running autoconf, automake, and configure. It
simplifies creating debug and release versions while keeping all compiler generated files out
of the source directories. The build script picks up where bootstrap leaves off and runs make to
create the binaries. Both scripts display help information when passed a -h(elp) or --h(elp)
argument. Running the two scripts in sequence without any arguments will create a default build
of Stylus.

Test the build by executing the following command from the root of the Stylus directory:

    ./stylus -e -r -- -g 52DC.gene -p simple.xml -u ./sample/,./sample/

If all is working, this will generate data and reports under the sample directory.

EXTERNAL REQUIREMENTS
The following must be installed prior to building or running Stylus:

- xmllib2 2.6.26 or greater (see http://xmlsoft.org/)
- swig 1.3.31 or greater (see http://www.swig.org/)
- Python 2.3 or greater (see http://python.org/)

SETTING UP AND RUNNING STYLUS
The Stylus User Guide gives detailed information on running Stylus through either the provided
scripts or by using its API. It is *not* necessary to install Stylus when using the provided
scripts from their location in the project (they find and use the locally built version).
