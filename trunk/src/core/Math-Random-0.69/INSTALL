Beginning with version 0.68, two versions of the phrtsd routine are
available. If you want the new version, run 'perl Makefile.PL' as
usual. If you want the original version, run:

   perl Makefile.PL phrtsd_orig

The original version, which is the same as the phrtsd routine in the
original Fortran library, generates the same seed numbers for all
permutations of the same characters. For instance, 'abc', 'bca',
and 'cab' will all generate the same seeds. Some users find this
behavior surprising. Also, when Math::Random is loaded, it sets the
seeds from scalar(localtime), which will be a string like
'Mon Jun 26 15:45:12 2006'. Nine seconds later, however,
'Mon Jun 26 15:45:21 2006' will generate the very same seeds.

The new version uses an entirely different algorithm that will
generate different seeds for such strings. This should be suitable
for most applications, but the original version is still available
for those who need to reproduce the behavior of the Fortran randlib.
