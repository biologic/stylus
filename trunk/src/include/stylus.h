 * \brief Public Stylus methods.
 *
 * This file declares the public methods through which callers interact with the
 * Stylus engine. See Stylus documentation for full details.
 *
 * \page overview Stylus Overview
 * \par Stylus is an engine to load, mutate, and analyze \em genomes that
 * contain \em genes corresponding to one or more Han glyphs. (See Stylus
 * documentation for full details.) The engine is designed to execute as
 * a task within a grid-network or cluster with one task per-CPU.
 * \par Stylus holds at most one genome whose state is represents the
 * active \em trial. Stylus moves from one trial to the next through a
 * sequence of mutation and validation.
 *
 * \section using Using Stylus
 * \par Callers must always initialize Stylus (via stInitialize()) before calling
 * any other routines and terminate Stylus (see stTerminate()) when finished.
 * \par After initialization, callers load a genome which may then be in one
 * of several possible states (e.g., DEAD, ALIVE). Callers interact with
 * Stylus by executing plans that create a series of trials.
 *
 * \section output Stylus Output
 * \par Stylus records several types of data as it process: Log records,
 * containing status messages (and trace statements in DEBUG builds), is written
 * to STDERR. Stylus will record, if requested, the genome at the end of 
 * selected trials. Provided enough details is included, these may be used to
 * re-execute a subpart of a plan (e.g., trials 1000-2000) recording
 * additional detail.
 *
 * \section errors Error Handling
 * \par Internally, Stylus tends to use C++ exceptions. At the interface boundary
 * it converts all of these into a ST_RETCODE value. Since the meaning of
 * specific values may change, callers should rely on constants and macros Stylus
 * provides for evaluation. Among others, these include methods to check for
 * success, failure, and obtain the details of the last error.
 *
 * \section threads Thread Safety
 * \par Stylus is \em not thread-safe. Stylus is designed to be used as task within a
 * distributed grid. Nor does Stylus support mechanisms for even creating mutliple
 * genomes per process.
 *
 * \section memory Memory Handling
 * \par When Stylus needs to return to the caller data of indeterminate size (e.g.,
 * a genome), the caller must provide a pre-allocated buffer large enough to hold
 * the requested object. If the buffer is not large-enough, Stylus will return the
 * number of bytes necessary and no data. The caller should, then, allocate a
 * larger buffer and re-invoke Stylus.
 *
 * \section tracing Trace Control
 * \par Stylus can write extremely detailed messages covering both the internal
 * flow of control and data structures. Stylus divides itself into \em regions
 * (e.g., XML processing, mutation handling) and categorizes trace statements
 * as either \em flow or \em data records. Further, trace records have an
 * associated numeric level ranging from all records disabled to all
 * records written. Lastly, callers can disable tracing until a particular
 * trial to minimize 'noise.' Stylus writes trace records to the log file (i.e.,
 * STDERR). Stylus starts with all tracing disabled.
 *
 * \section misc Miscellaneous Notes
 * \par
 * - Stylus uses 0-based indexes (i.e., the first position is index 0)
 * - Stylus uses the C/C++ \c char type for all character data
 * - All XML data is null-terminated, UTF-8 encoded strings (passed as \c char)
 * - Stylus requires C callers to include <stdbool.h>

	 * \brief Method to execute a plan on the active genome
	 * 
	 * A plans is a series of mutations applied to the genome that creates trials.

	 * 
	 * Plan execution always begins at the next trial; that is, the genome must be
	 * ALIVE prior to executing a plan and will be advanced before applying the first
	 * step of the plan.
	 * 
	 * By default, the first step of a plan is assumed to correspond with trial one;
	 * plan execution will skip steps up through that corresponding to the current
	 * trial. The caller may specify the trial to associate with the first step of
	 * a plan (this allows executing multiple plans in succession on a genome).
	 * Specifying zero for the initial trial will align the first step of the
	 * plan with the current state (with execution begining at the next trial).
	 * To rerun part of a plan (perhaps to record more detail), the caller should
	 * load the genome from the last trial before where they want to begin (e.g.,
	 * load trial ten to begin with trial eleven) and specify the trial that properly
	 * aligns the plan. (Most often, this is one, but if mutliple plans were executed,
	 * then it may be a trial greater than one and less than the current trial.)
	 * 
	 * Also, by default, execution will applying all steps within the plan. The
	 * caller may limit this by specifying a trial count that is less than the
	 * steps remaining in the plan. Specifying zero (or a value exceeding the steps
	 * remaining in the plan) will execute all remaining steps.
	 * 
	 * Lastly, the caller may receive intermittent feedback by supplying the address of a 
	 * callback function and a rate at which to be called. Stylus will invoke the callback
	 * function at the successful completion of every trial modulo the passed rate. The caller
	 * may stop plan execution by returing 'false' from the callback. From within the callback,
	 * the caller may retrieve statistics, adjust the record rate, logging, and/or tracing.
	 * 
	 * \param[in] pxmlPlan Pointer to XML plan to execute
	 * \param[in] iTrialFirst Genome trial to associate with the plan (0 selects the current trial plus one)
	 * \param[in] cTrials Number of trials to execute (0 executes all remaining trials)
	 * \param[in] pfnStatus Pointer to callback status function (may be NULL)

	 * \remarks
	 * - The current implementation does not take full advantage of multiple states,
	 *	 but leaves the infrastructure in place. Future versions may expose more
	 *	 internal states such that callers can have more operational control (e.g.,
	 *	 force a validation and rollback based on their own criteria).
